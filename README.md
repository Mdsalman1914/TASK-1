Project : Create a C++ program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. provide feedback on whether the guess is too high or to low until the user guesses the correct number

How it works:

1. The program seeds the random number generator with the current time.
2. It generates a random number between 1 and 100.
3. It prompts the user to guess the number, counting the number of attempts.
4. After each guess, it provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
The game continues until the user guesses the correct number, at which point it congratulates them and displays the number of attempts
